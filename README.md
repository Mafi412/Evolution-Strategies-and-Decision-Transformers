# Evolution Strategies and Decision Transformers

In this repository, there is a codebase (*codebase* directory) and data from experiments (*data* directory) for paper ***Utilizing Evolution Strategies to Train Transformers in Reinforcement Learning*** by **Matyáš Lorenc**.

More information about the algorithms, the architecture, the experiments performed, and even the motivation behind this work can be found in the text of the article.

## Directory *codebase*

Here, we can find our implementation of the OpenAI-ES and scripts carrying out the training (*train_\*.py*) of a given model (feed-forward or decision transformer), the scripts enabling us to simulate the trained agents (*play_\*.py*), and a script to plot the resulting logs (*plot_experiment.py*).

## Directory *data*

Here in this directory, we can find results of the experiments. This means trained models, log files and plots.
